<h1>Firebase-Chatapp</h1>

ðŸ”§ Technology Stack:

Frontend: I develop modern and dynamic user interfaces using React.js and React-DOM. I use Sass to manage application styles, allowing me to write more modular and maintainable CSS code.
Backend: Leveraging Firebase's fast and reliable cloud infrastructure, I have developed a forum project where users can easily communicate in different chat rooms.
Database: I efficiently store users' messages, profile pictures, sending dates, and the rooms they were sent in using Firebase Realtime Database.
Other Tools: I utilize tools like Git and GitHub for project management and process improvement. Additionally, I focus on continuously researching and experimenting with new technologies to enhance my skills.
ðŸŽ¯ My Project: ChatApp
ChatApp enables users to comfortably chat in different chat rooms and seamlessly switch between them. Users' messages, profile pictures, sending dates, and the rooms they were sent in are securely stored in the Firebase system.
